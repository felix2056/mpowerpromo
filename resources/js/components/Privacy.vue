            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>Effective Date of Current Policy: March 13, 2019.</p>

            <p>
                Thank you for using MPower Promo. We understand that choosing and working with

                we respect your and your client’s privacy. We take this trust very
                seriously, and make it our highest priority to ensure the security and
                confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Please read the
                following policy to learn about our privacy practices.
            </p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Service and unless
                otherwise noted, all references to “we”, “us”,

                affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”).
            </p>

            <p>
                MPower encourages you to review the privacy policy statements of websites you
                choose to link to from MPower so that you can understand how those websites

                In light of constantly evolving data privacy laws, rules, regulations and
                industry best practices, we must reserve the right to revise this Policy from
                time to time. When we do so, we will modify the “Last Updated”
                date listed above. Further, if we deem any change material in our sole and
                absolute discretion, we may post a related notice in our software and/or

                websites, including without limitation mpowerpromo.com, app.mpowerpromo.com,
                and related sites (collectively, the “Websites”), and/or any of
                our Services (as that term is defined on our Terms of Service), shall
                constitute your acceptance of any revisions we make.
            </p>

            <h2>What Personal Information We Collect</h2>

            <p>
                In general, you can browse our Website without revealing any personally
                identifiable information about yourself. At various times, you may decide to
                provide us with personally identifiable information. This information may
                include, but is not limited to, your name, your home, billing, or other
                physical address, your email address, and your phone number, certain
                information about your clients and their homes, access information for your
                home, as well as any information associated with the foregoing. If you request
                or purchase products from MPower or our Service Partners, we collect billing
                and credit card information (although we use a third party payment processor,
                as described below). We also collect information you provide via telephone or
                electronic mail and, in some cases, in the course of in-person interactions
                with us. This permits us to communicate with you about our Services and
                related topics.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to information you voluntarily provide to us, we also
                automatically collect certain non-personal, technical information about you
                and/or your devices as you interact with our Websites or Services, and we
                store that information in log files. For example, we may collect your IP
                address, browser type, internet service provider, operating system, click
                stream data, the pages you view on any or all of our Websites, the pages you
                view before and after viewing our Websites and any search terms you use on any
                of our Websites. This permits us to recognize you and personalize your
                experience on our Websites, and, more generally, to improve our Websites and
                Services as a result of any learnings we may glean from information collected.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may also collect information about you from third parties who already have
                your information in their possession, custody or control, as part of our
                normal outbound marketing efforts.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Collect Your Information</h2>

            <p>
                In addition to collecting personal information that you provide to MPower, we
                may collect data through cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and other
                monitoring technologies that enables us to track the actions of users of our
                Site and help personalize your experience with our Site.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pixel tags or web beacons are tracking devices on websites or emails that can
                monitor the behavior of users visiting a website or users that are recipients
                of an email. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your hard disk by
                a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
                to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read
                by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. By showing how
                and when visitors use our Websites, cookies help us see which areas are
                popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to our Websites are
                based on data we collect, such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
                This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information
                from cookies to better tailor our Websites and Services to our users’
                needs.
            </p>

            <h2>How Your Personal Information and Business Data is Used</h2>

            <p>
                MPower collects and uses your personal information to operate its Site and
                deliver the services you have requested. Those requests may come from a
                variety of different means, including Task Requests, Service Agreements with
                MPower or its affiliates, or homeowner requests by phone call, email, text,
                and more. Please see our Terms of Service or reach out to MPower’s
                offices for more information. MPower may also use your personally identifiable
                information to inform you of other products or services available from MPower
                and its affiliates. The Company may also contact you via surveys to conduct
                research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services
                that may be offered.
            </p>

            <p>
                MPower may post customer stories or testimonials on the Site, which may
                contain personally identifiable information. If you wish to request the
                removal of your customer story or testimonial, you can contact us directly to
                do so.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may share certain personal information with our third party vendors if
                necessary to provide Services to our customers. For example, all financial,
                credit, and billing information that we collect is used solely to check the
                qualifications of prospective customers for various Services and, where
                appropriate, to bill for those Services.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may also occasionally engage third parties to provide certain Services to
                our customers and/or, in turn, their customers. Further, we may provide
                certain Services jointly with selected business partners. In such
                circumstances, third parties and partners are not permitted to retain, share,
                store or use your information for any other purpose than to deliver the
                relevant Service(s) in a professional manner, and consistent with their legal,
                regulatory and other obligations.
            </p>

            <p>
                MPower may keep track of the pages our users visit within MPower, in order to
                determine how users are using the Site and improve the experience and
                operation of the Site.
            </p>

            <p>
                MPower will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if
                required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
                necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal
                process served on MPower or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or
                property of MPower; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the
                personal safety of users of MPower, or the public.
            </p>

            <h2>How Your Anonymous Data May Be Used</h2>

            <p>
                We may now or at some point in the future collect certain information about
                how different constituencies (e.g., our customers, our customers’
                customers, vendors, etc.) interact with our Services on an anonymous basis.
                For example, we collect certain information designed to help us understand how
                our customers manage their properties within the MPower. In that case, the
                information we collect does not include information that could identify you
                personally.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may anonymize the information we collect about your use of our Services by
                removing or “hashing” any data fields (such as name, address and
                telephone number) that identify you or that can be used to identify you
                personally.
            </p>

            <p>
                We aggregate information by combining anonymous data that meet certain
                criteria into groups. For example, we might want to know average rental prices
                for a particular market so as to better understand how to communicate with our
                property manager customers and prospects in that market or so that we can
                communicate more broadly about market trends by region or similar issues. The
                resulting data aggregation would be an anonymized aggregated total that we
                could then share without disclosing any personal or sensitive information. As
                stated above, we do not and will not sell your usage data to third parties.
            </p>

            <p>Your Control of and Access to Your Personal Information</p>

            <p>
                As discussed above, you can choose not to provide us with any information,
                although it may be needed to use our products and services.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent
                your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you
                when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please

                If you have any questions regarding your personally identifiable information,

                We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving
                communications from MPower that are promotional in nature. Opting out of
                receiving communications with us does not affect our communications with you
                via telephone or email related to products or services you purchase from us.
                Users may opt-out of receiving communications from MPower by contacting us at

            <h2>How Third Parties May Use Your Information</h2>

            <p>
                Our Websites and/or Services may contain links to or integrations with third
                party websites. These third party websites maintain their own policies
                regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal and non-personal
                information. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such
                third parties with respect to their collection or use of your information. We
                encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website that you visit,
                including those you may reach through a link on our Website(s) or in our
                Services.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to Our Business</h2>

            <p>
                In the event that MPower goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
                acquisition by or combination with another company, or a sale of all or a
                portion of our assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be
                among the assets transferred.
            </p>

            <h2>Children Under Thirteen</h2>

            <p>
                MPower does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                children under the age of thirteen, in accordance with the Children’s
                Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). However, incidental
                exposure to this information may be possible if, for example, our customers
                upload this information to one of our Services or it is inadvertently captured
                by our marketing organization.
            </p>

            <p>Information about European Union General Data Protection Regulation</p>

            <p>
                We exclusively market and sell our Services to United States-based
                organizations and individuals. Even though we do not intentionally collect
                information about residents of the European Union (“EU”), some EU
                residents’ data may be inadvertently collected through marketing
                channels or by virtue of our customers’ legitimate use of our Services.
                Collection and storage of any EU resident’s data by us is minimal and
                incidental. No such data is used for marketing or any other purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are an EU resident and would like to
                request that your data be securely removed from our systems, however
                collected, please send an email with proof of EU residency to
                info@mpowerpromo.com. We will remove all relevant data, so long as that
                removal is technically feasible, does not impact the legitimate accounting or
                business practices of our customers, and does not violate other regulatory or
                legal standards with which we must comply. We will also cooperate with our
                customers in good faith to address any requests they receive or that may
                impact them directly.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to this Statement</h2>

            <p>
                We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Please review this Policy
                periodically to be informed on what information we collect, how we collect
                that information, and how we use the information that we collect.
            </p>
