                    (c) rightfully obtained by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party; or (d)
                    independently developed by the receiving Party. The receiving Party shall not disclose the disclosing

                    who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving Party to exercise its rights or
                    perform its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential
                    Information to the limited extent required (i) in order to comply with the order of a court or other
                    governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the Party
                    making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other Party
                    and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (ii) to establish a Party's rights under
                    this Agreement, including to make required court filings. On the expiration or termination of the
                    Agreement, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all copies, whether in
                    written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or
                    destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing Party that such Confidential
                    Information has been destroyed. Each Party's obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential
                    Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire five years from the date first
                    disclosed to the receiving Party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that
                    constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure
                    will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential
                    Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.</li>

                            certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid). Except
                            as
                            otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the
                            receiving Party; and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of
                            this Section.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><u>Force Majeure.</u> In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed
                            to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under
                            this
                            Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments), if and to the extent such failure or
                            delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such Party's reasonable control, including but not
                            limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or
                            other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or
                            passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an
                            embargo.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><u>Amendment and Modification; Waiver.</u> Provider reserves the right to amend any pricing
                            related to Customer’s subscription and any Exhibits to this Agreement, at their sole discretion,
                            with two months’ notice to Customer, and to amend any other part of the Agreement 15 days before
                            the beginning of a Renewal Period, so long as Customer receives 10 days’ advance notice before
                            such amendment. Except for the exceptions listed above in this section 12(D), no amendment to or
                            modification of this Agreement is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized
                            representative of each Party. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof will be
                            effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. Except as
                            otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (i) no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any
                            rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement will operate or be construed as
                            a
                            waiver thereof, and (ii) no single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege
                            hereunder will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
                            right,
                            remedy, power, or privilege.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><u>Severability.</u> If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
                            any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other
                            term
                            or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
                            any
                            other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
                            illegal,
                            or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
                            effect their original intent as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
                            that
                            the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
                            extent possible.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><u>Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.</u> This Agreement is governed by and construed in
                            accordance with the internal laws of the State of Utah without giving effect to any choice or
                            conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of
                            any
                            jurisdiction other than those of the State of Utah. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding
                            arising
                            out of this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder will be instituted exclusively in the
                            federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Utah in each case located in
                            the
                            city of Salt Lake City and County of Salt Lake County, and each Party irrevocably submits to the
                            exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><u>Assignment.</u> Customer may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations
                            hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise,
                            without the prior written consent of Provider, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
                            conditioned, or delayed. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section
                            will
                            be null and void. No assignment or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating Party of
                            any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of
                            the
                            Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.</li>
                        <li><u>Export Regulation.</u> Customer shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations,
                            and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export
                            license or other governmental approval), that prohibit or restrict the export or re-export of
                            the
                            Services or any Customer Data outside the US.</li>
                        <li><u>Equitable Relief.</u> Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach
                            by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 6 or, in the case of Customer, Section
                            2(c),
                            would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate
                            remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will
                            be
                            entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific
                            performance,
                            and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a
                            bond
                            or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate
                            remedy.
                            Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available
                            at
                            law, in equity, or otherwise.</li>
                        <li><u>Counterparts.</u> This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is deemed an
                            original, but all of which together are deemed to be one and the same agreement.</li>
